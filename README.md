============

Several examples I followed while initially learning Node.js

	1) Open up a windows command prompt and browse to the location the file is located at.
	2) type "node hello.js" you should see a message "Server started". Make sure node is installed on your computer.
	3) Go to a brwoser and type the URL http://localhost:8080 and click enter.
	4) The browser shuld display a hello world message.
